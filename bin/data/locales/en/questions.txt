Who are you?
What is this place?
Where do you get these goods from?
Who's talking to me?
Who's running this place?
Why is the research institute killing outsiders?
Why the story of the game has changed course sharply?
Why does the former head of the research institute call himself 'Ivan' and why should Ivan be the only one?
Where did the research institute come from and why is the entrance to it in the basement of an abandoned house?
