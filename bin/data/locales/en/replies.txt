So you came here after all...$$$A good choice, so to speak...$$$Let's get down to business... In this basement (by no means the smallest) you can collect coins and pass "floors"...$$$$$$This, by the way, is the first...$$$$You must go all the way to the descent below... Good luck to you!
So, you have passed the first floor.$$$$You know, it seemed to me that you won’t pass it...$$$$But...$$I hope you understand that there will be no simpler corridors?$$$$$you should go through the mazes to get to the descent.$$$$Good luck!
Stop... what?$$Is the door closed?$$Who did this?$$She was open!!!$$Well, I know what to do ... Go down the corridor and you will find the key to this door there. DO IT!!
Closed? Again? What the F...?$$$Okay... Right now I’ll remember where the key is...$$$$...Here's what I'll tell you: the key is somewhere nearby$$$$I think you can find him.
You found the key!$$$Well, let's go back to the door!$$$
...$$Wait... The key did not fit?$$$$And how do we get further now?$$$$Let me think ...$$$... Wait, I remembered! Somewhere near the door there is a secret passage, try to go through it.$$$$$$Meet me on the next floor!
Oh, the choice...$$Behind one of these turns lies the key to the door...$$$$Time to choose


Closed again?$$This is important, this time I'm not fooling: the key is somewhere in that corridor behind you.
So, the key in this room ...$$$But getting to it will not be so easy...$$$$These spikes periodically rise and fall. You just have to get past them.$$$$$Go ahead!
I hasten to warn you: this floor is a death trail!$$$$Goodbye!! (this is in case you die)...
Which one? Why are there so many spikes here?$$$$Well, I started with the wrong question...$$$$HOW DO YOU PASS THE SECRET TUNNEL IN THE ROOM WITH A KEY ?????$$$$$But what happened was not returned, so you need to find a way out of this situation...$$$$$$Perhaps you triggered some kind of alarm that blocked your access to the key...$$$$$Somewhere on this floor, as far as I remember, there is a button that turns it off...
\bStop, is it already recording?$$$\bHow much is already going?$$$\bCan’t you rewrite it?
Okay...$$So, Chosen One, you have passed this strip of trials...
I hope you weren’t embarrassed by the "technical problems" at the beginning of this post...
Anyway, you (deleted)
As you already understood, the money that was written on the plate near the descent is not so easy to get...
To take the money and come back from here alive, you need to go through the whole test path...
...$And yes, the reverse moves automatically close behind you...
Therefore, you cannot escape from here...
...$\bWhat? Is recording still going on? I clicked "Stop"!
\b...Ah, the button is not immediately activated...$$$$\bWhy then in this kennel such fucking equipment??$$$$\bAlthough, however, why am I arguing with you...
\b(whispering) Eh...another chosen-goof went through that “very complicated room..."$$$$$\b...you need to kill him as soon as possible...$$$$\b...$$\bstop, can he hear me?$$$\b...Okay...$$Ahem ahem !! So, Chosen One, you went through that test room...$$$$As you noticed (or didn't notice), the previous floor was empty...$$$$...I hope you are not bored...$$$By the way, I have a surprise for you...$$$You will see him...around the bend...$$$\b...$$\b...we need better weapons of killing...$$$$\b...$$\bDidn’t you turn off the microphone?
...Funny...$$The exit is both close and far...$$$On the one hand, it’s close at hand...$$$$But on the other, you still need to go somewhere else to disconnect this...device...$$$$$...Otherwise...you will remain here until the end of time...$$$$$...Or maybe you will run to the bullets - and then you will die...$$$$$Who knows what will happen during this time...
\bWell then...we finally trapped him...$$$$\bNow, in any case, he will die - either from a stray bullet, or from dehydration, starvation and other delights...$$$$$$\bAnd when he does die - no matter when - we can complete what we started...$$$$$\b...$$\bStop talking with pathetic phrases and get to work...
One time...$$Yeah, it still works...$$$Traveler, you are in a very unpleasant position...$$$$The door programmed for temporary opening closes in front of your nose...$$$$$Looks like you have haters who did such...dirty tricks...$$$$You sit here for now, and now I will instantly solve this problem... (quiet laugh)
Sorry for this floor...$$$During its construction, the workers did not calculate their strength...$$$$$Therefore, the room was too large for the tasks...$$$$...And for the full use of the entire space, they had to build a long corridor before the exit...$$$$$$...Yes, yes, I also hope that this will be the last time...$$$$$
\vUm...hi...$$\vI...this...here...$$$\vStop! WHY ARE YOU STUPIDLY STANDING AND SILENT???$$$$\vWait a minute...you don’t have a mouth!$$$$\v...$$\vWait...how did I not immediately pay attention to it...$$$$\vThe comrade who is standing in front of me is just a controlled doll...$$$$$\vWell then, I have to turn to someone else...$$$$\v...$$\vThe player, finally I realized who came to me...$$$$\vThe protagonist of this game is not worthy to be a versatile person.$$$$$\vTherefore, the role of studying the world of this game goes to you...$$$$$\vOf course you can object...$$$\vBUT I will tell you the following: if you already turned on this game, then you signed a contract to study the secrets of this “basement”.$$$$$$$\vSomething I digress...$$$\vIf something is not clear to you, then ask me about this matter.$$$$$\vPerhaps I can give a worthy answer, which the author of replicas for this game prescribed for me in advance...$$$$$$\v...$$\vIn my opinion, I said something superfluous...
\vWho am i?$$\vIf you answer right away - then I’m a robot named Vitalya (I gave this name to myself: my identification number has been erased, and I forgot it), however it doesn’t matter...$$$$$$$$$\vAnd if this is not enough, then I gave a little more information...$$$$$\vI sell all sorts of products that change your gameplay beyond recognition...
\vTo be honest, I know little about this place...$$$$\vAs far as I know, I was born here in this strange place...$$$$$\v...Ignore what I say...$$$\vAlthough I am a robot, but I feel like a man with a capital letter...$$$$$\v...Only one very annoying circumstance does not give me such an opportunity...$$$$$\vMy brain...how to say it...the neural connections in my brain were programmed in the SO ANCIENT PROGRAM LANGUAGE that you cannot imagine (substitute in your head any YP that you hate)...$$$$$$$$\vIn general, because of this, my mind is limited, no matter how I try to get around this humiliating restriction...$$$$$$$\v...$$\vBack to the topic...$$$\vAccording to my observations, someone lures into this, let's call it a “basement”, all sorts of idiots who are looking for free money here...$$$$$$$\vSo there are more than one such "Chosen One"...$$$$\vThere were many before you...$$$$\vI helped them as best I could: I sold things that could help them pass these tests, aimed at killing most of the people who got here...$$$$$$$\vAs far as I know, they did not survive...$$$$\vProbably because they were not controlled by the player...$$$$$\vBy the way! If during your wanderings you find something strange or incomprehensible, then at our next meeting tell us about it...
\vYou know, I'll tell you about it...$$$$\vOnly you do not spill anyone...$$$$\vWell, I hope that you will not tell any of your friends about the secrets of the game you are playing...$$$$$$$\vIn any case, listen (read soon):$$$$\vI wander around this strange place and collect all sorts of things.$$$$$$\vBut not every one: I take for myself only that which I was able to identify with my, unfortunately, limited mind (bl__b, Tolik eb__ik, thank you for that)$$$$$$$$\vWho is this Tolik?$$$\v...$$\v...It's too early for you to know...$$$$\vYes, and I know almost nothing about him...$$$$\vIf you find him - try to avenge me...$$$$\v...I hope you find something useful for yourself...
...$In order not to lose your or my time, I will quickly bring you up to date.$$$If I don’t succeed on the recording (away from the microphone),$$$am I recording the first take? then during processing I will speed up the resulting audio recording...$$$In any case, by clicking on the button near the door, both entrance doors of the maze open, but for a limited time, which even we...that is, I don’t know...$$$$$during this time, whatever it is, you must get from point A to point B...$$...If anything, you're at point A...$GO!
\rI greet you, test subject!$$$$\rIf you listen to this message, it means that you have been honored to check on yourself the latest domestic inventions (insert invention name)...$$
\rSo, whoever you are, you are in the Superman Drink Test Zone, which, according to our records, can turn muscles into stone.$$$$$$\r...To verify the effectiveness of this tool, we developed a series of cameras that are under constant machine gun fire.$$$$$$\rHowever, if you forgot to give a sample of the Drink or if it did not work properly, do not worry: only under heavy fire we will understand if this Drink worked.$$$$$$\rIf you are died, it’s okay: after your death, your family, if any, will receive a lifetime premium at the expense of the state...$$
\vOh, hi!$$\vI know you! You're as...$$$\vDo I even know you ??$$$\vHave I met you before?$$$\v...$$\vWait a minute!...$$$\vIf you are here, then...$$$\vSo...$$\vSo...that you...$$$\vWhat did you...SURVIVED FROM OUR LAST MEETING !!!$$$$\vWell that's good...$$$\vYou, therefore, are more likely to get out of here...$$$$\vI think that between this, the past and our subsequent meetings you will have new questions, and I assure you, this place holds many secrets and mysteries...$$$$$$$\vAt least I think so...$$$\vIn short, we turn to the questions on your part...
\v...$$$$$$$$$\v...Do not worry!$$$\vThe game did not freeze...$$$\vI just thought...$$$\vAnd I realized who you're talking about...$$$$\v...do you want to know his name?$$$\vI would tell it to you, but I cannot do this for two reasons...$$$$\vFirstly, I’m a little afraid of him, although I have never seen him...$$$$$\vAnd secondly, you, as a player, need to leave a secret, intrigue...call what you want in order to arouse your interest in passing...$$$$$$$$\v...$$\vTherefore, for now, we restrict ourselves to such a name as “Mysterious Voice”...
\vI don’t know why you need this information...$$$$\vI don’t even know how it can be useful to you...$$$$\v...$$\vBut, oddly enough, I can give you an answer to this question...$$$$$\vWhen I once wandered around the back streets of this place, I learned two things...$$$$$\vFirst, this place is called the “Scientific Research Institute of Scientific Development and Advanced Technologies”$$$$$$$$\vAnd the second, according to the documents, led this place...$$$$$\v...$$\vWell...$$$\vCampaign I managed to forget this information...$$$$\vOkay...we will assume that this game convention is necessary to maintain intrigue...$$$$$\v...$$\vDude, I thought I would say something else???
\vHonestly, I don’t know why...$$$\vRather, I know, but I do not remember the reason...$$$$\v...$$\vWait a minute...$$$\vSomewhere among the pieces of paper I read about it...$$$$\vOr listened to audio recordings...$$$\vIn general, if my memory serves me well, then the entries said this:$$$$\v...Due to financial difficulties, the turnover of security personnel has arisen.$$$$$\vTherefore, the leadership began to hire any rabble that could be paid as little as possible.$$$$$\vHowever, such workers were one-day workers, and they came to work to plunder the property of the laboratory.$$$$$\vFrom this moment, the management realized that they did not need such employees.$$$$$\vTherefore, they decided to purchase a “Set of Security Systems” in order to do without security and save laboratory \vequipment from invasions...$$$$$$$\v...$$\vSomething like that...$$$\v...$$\vI hope you understand...
\vOkay...$$\vSo the short hour of parting came...$$$\vI hope your character will live until our next meeting...$$$$\vDo your best to make this happen...
\rI have to record this and other messages as quickly as possible.$$$$\rOtherwise, I will have to stay at work, so I will come home late.$$$$\rOk, let's get down to business.$$$\rSo Lab, I have two news for you...$$$$\rFirstly, today you cannot perform your direct duties.$$$$\rSecondly, instead you will be here, under my supervision.$$$$\rI will periodically encourage you throughout the action.$$$$\rWhat will you do?$$\rYou will check on your own skin and experience the new product of our research institute - Round Boulders.$$$$$$\rSurely you wonder why we are testing them today?$$$$\rBut the fact is that the purchase of these damn security systems did not solve our problems.$$$$$\rThere really is no protection from them, and we spent a lot of money.$$$$$\rNow we are trying to save on everything, even on scientific developments.$$$$$\r...$\rYes, yes, I try to be optimistic.$$$
\rSo i'm back.$$$\rWhen you went upstairs, I had one idea.$$$$\rYou know, laboratory assistant, these boulders can be used as walls.$$$$$\rJust think !!!$$$\rThanks to them, you can create a room of any size!$$$$\rHowever, this requires a huge empty room.$$$$\rFortunately, we have a lot of them.$$$$\rBUT! The first versions of such rooms will not be available in the near future, since the builders are busy building such rooms, and this technology has yet to be verified.$$$$$$\rWho knows, laboratory assistant, maybe you can do it too.
\rLab Assistant!!$$$\rThis message, which was not written in advance, wants to warn you that our savings are declining faster...$$$$$$$\rAlthough, perhaps, I misinterpreted...but so far medium-fast...$$$$\rIn general, our current red buttons now only work clamped.$$$$\rIn any case, everything will be fine with the old ones: they will also gather dust in the warehouse.$$$$$\rYou can start!$$$
\rSo-so!$\rI returned!!$$\rI was..a little busy.$$$\r...$\rHey! Money!!$$\rI'm not talking about a coin that miraculously rolled into my office...$$$$$\rAlthough yes, it is it...$$$\rIn general, Laboratory Assistant, you somehow miraculously found a secret room where the builders left some extra boulders that remained after construction.$$$$$$\r...$\rCome on!$$\rWhat am I lying to you?$$\rIt was just one of the boulder vaults!$$$\rSeriously! The builders have not even made layouts yet...$$$$\rIn general, you can be proud of your unique and originality.$$$$\r*quiet chuckle*
\rLab assistent, I have good news for you!$$$$\rThe builders finally built the first room, based on the trial versions of your colleagues who pass this test at the same time.$$$$$$$\rSince by the rules I should not talk about other subjects, pretend that I did not tell you this...$$$$$$\rIf someone finds out about this, then...I'm afraid to even imagine what will happen to me...and to you, too.$$$$$$\rAs laboratory directors, they can fire me for my incompetence...$$$$$\rAnd they will come up with reasons, I guarantee that...$$$$\r...$\rTherefore, to avoid dire consequences, do not tell your colleagues about it over a cup...of a drink.$$$$$$\r...I hope we understand each other.$$$$
\rLab Assistant, I'm sorry I forgot to warn you...$$$$\rThe fact is that human power is not enough to move two boulders that are nearby.$$$$$\rTherefore, do not crap and continue the test...
\rLab Assistant!$$\rDue to the fact that the number of dead laboratory personnel is growing steadily, I found another application for our round boulders.$$$$$$$\rNow they can close the machine guns.$$$$\rThis will greatly reduce the mortality of our laboratory assistants, and the protection of the laboratory will increase.$$$$$$\rYour task: to test for yourself how well the boulders protect against bullets, and special workers will draw conclusions based on statistical data...$$$$$$$\rCome on!$$\r...$\r(away from the microphone) We need to conduct the next selection of new employees of my...that is...our...Research Institute...$$$
Listen, it's me...$$$The one I was with you earlier...$$$$If anything, I continue to watch you...$$$$It’s just that this series of tests with “boulders” seemed to me enough...interesting...for you...$$$$$$I see you are not very bored from my absence...$$$$...$$Come back to the test...
\rLab Assistant, I'm sorry that I forgot to warn you that our boulders, although not broken by bullets, are too poorly crumbled into powder if they run into spikes...$$$$$$$$\r...I was hoping that you yourself would guess about it...$$$$\rWell, now you're stuck here forever.$$$$\rDo not worry about this: your skeleton will then be removed from these premises...$$$$$\rEverything, you can prepare for a quick instant or slow painful death...
\rSo, those who want to get a job here: now I will announce a few rules...$$$$$$\rFirst: even if you do not get into our team, then leave a pleasant impression after yourself...$$$$$$\rCleaners get so little for their work....$$$$\rKh-Khm...Second: if your name is Ivan, then boldly turn around and leave here! I am the leader here and decide who to hire and who not...$$$$$$$$\rOtherwise: if there are two Ivanas in our research institute, then they will contact me less with laudatory comments...$$$$$$$\rAnd the third rule, which is addressed to the technical group: if this pre-recorded message will not be played back in the right place, then I will FIRST YOU right there AND LEAD OUT THE ENTRANCE DOOR WITH YOUR THINGS!!$$$$$$$$\r...I hope you got what I meant...
\rOh...Lab Assistant, I'm sorry, I didn’t notice you...$$$$\r...$\r...The air smelled awkward...$$$\r...$\r...Well, try to tear it apart...$$$\r(whisper, away from the microphone) Ivanchik, pack your spirits! At least you managed to simulate awkwardness...$$$$$$\rSo! There will be no boulders in this part of the test...But there is good news: a new product of our research institute came directly from the conveyor: Secret Pit In the Floor...$$$$$$$$True, this is its early version, it has not been tested yet...and it is not yet secret...$$$$Your task is to pass this test, and people with higher education, whom I picked up in the gateway, will appreciate your work on a scale from 0 to 1...$$$$$$$$That's it, start: our experts want to see the sight...that is, your passing this "level"...
\rI say right away: this message is meaningless, because you're probably dead...$$$$$\rBy while you're conscious, listen to me!$$$$\rYour not very reasonable actions have had a double effect...$$$$$\rOn the one hand, you made the personnel problem...one more problematic...$$$$$\rBut on the other hand, your death will go into statistics, on the basis of which experts will draw certain conclusions...$$$$$$$\rWell, you can die with the thought that your death will advance science for many years to come...$$$$$$\r...Am I too far too far with the Laboratory Assistant?$$$$\r...$\rYes, he went to hell!$$$\rBut the quality of staff will increase...
\rSo, Lab Assistent, if you are listening to this message, then you have passed the “hidden pit” test.$$$$$$\rUnfortunately, some of your colleagues managed to fall into visible pits...$$$$$\rBUT! What can I tell you, Laboratory Assistant...Since after the tests there were people with average intelligence, it's time to get rid of some of these employees...$$$$$$$$\rIn general, pits can no longer be just taken and seen...$$$$$\rA little luck will come in handy for you...and the skill of reincarnation in addition...$$$$$$\rOh yes, Lab Assistant, the device of reincarnation has not yet been invented...$$$$$\rIf you pass this series of tests, you will probably be testing it...$$$$$\r(whispering) The main thing is that I have a lot of human subjects left...ahem...bodies...for experiments...$$$$$$$
\rLab assistant, let's get down to business right away...$$$$\rOur “hidden pits” are bearing fruit: there are fewer intruders and outsiders...$$$$$\rHowever, among the staff, everything is not so rosy...because of the tests, other Laboratory assistants died...$$$$$$\rWell, that’s already in the past...$$$$\rLaboratory assistant, in order to protect the remaining employees before the mass hiring at the research institute, I decided to give a brief safety briefing before deadly moments...$$$$$$$$\rFor example, “Round Boulders” can be driven into “Hidden Pits”, thereby deactivating the trap and creating a passage through which you can already safely pass...$$$$$$$$\rKeep in mind, Laboratory Assistant, that due to my busy work schedule, I and my close circle can forget to give instructions or turn them on in the right places, and they can also mix up their location...$$$$$$$$\rI’ll try to find a solution to the current problems, and you, Lab Assistant, pass the test...$$$$$$
\rWell, Lab Assistant, you went through this floor...$$$$$\rAlthough you survived by some miracle, I want to tell you one terrible news...$$$$$\rSomeone managed to get through our perfect defense...$$$$$\rMoreover, this someone broke through the so-called “basement passage” to us...$$$$$\rAlthough I’m not a psychic, it seems to me that this was the old owner of this basement...$$$$$$\rBut nothing, everything will be fine...First, we will catch him, interrogate him, and then we will figure out what to do with him...$$$
\rFull Name?$$Gubenko Zakhar Petrovich!$$$\rOccupation?$$The speculator and the huckster!$$$\rNickname?$$Moonshiner!
\rSo Lab Assistant, you passed the final round boulders test...$$$$$\rAs you walk along the long corridor before the exit, I will tell you a few facts...$$$$$$\rFirst: did you know that you could pass the test in several ways?$$$$$\r...You did not know about them ??$$$$\rYou can go by standard...by standard...and by...by standard...$$$$$\rTherefore...Your non-standard way of passing the test will fall into the statistics for testing the "round boulder"...$$$$$$$\rThe second fact: because of my workload, I decided to hire another person who will voice the PRM(Pre-Recorded Messages)...But do not be upset: I will sometimes voice some messages...$$$$$$$$\rThe third fact: this person will become...Gubenko Zakhar Petrovich, a former felon and part-time resident of the house from which the research institute was formed and developed from the basement.$$$$$$$$$\rFourth fact: on the basis of the moonshine still of our new employee, some laboratory assistants are working on “Reincarnation drinks” or possibly “Immortality drinks”...$$$$$$$$\rSince I doubt their successes, I suggest that you, Laboratory Assistant, call such scientists nothing more than “Mad Scientists” or “Madentists”...$$$$$$$\rAnd yes...Laboratory assistant, the test "Boulders" is over...$
\vWow, whom I see!$$$\vPlayer, you went through another chapter of this game...$$$$$\vI must admit, I am glad about this, because if you are alive, then you have more chances to get out of here...$$$$$$\vFor these 10 levels, if you did not understand, you were in the old test zone of the product of the Research Institute "Round Boulders".$$$$$$$$\vAnd so to speak, you had to dive deep into history to get answers to old questions and a couple of new questions...$$$$$$$\vIn short, the time of questions on your part...
\vThere are several possible answers to this question...$$$$\vFirstly, it’s as if you are going through the old premises of the research institute, where there were old PRM recorded by the previous management...$$$$$$$$\vSecondly, the reason is still the same: playing with such a technique probably creates even more questions over the conditional "basement secret".$$$$$$$$\v...$\vI hope that you can reach the end of the game where, in theory, there should be answers to all the questions received...$$$$$$$
\vI’ll tell you this: when I wandered around the corners of the “basement”, I also came across the PRM,$$$$$$\vwhere he said that he adored when he was praised, respected, etc.$$$$$\vIn short, he had a Sense of Self-Importance, due to which Ivan decided that the shorter they call him, the more long-term approvals he will receive...$$$$$$$$\vAnd about the second question...$$$\vThis is obvious: if two Ivana work in the research institute, then there will be confusion or all approvals will go the other way...$$$$$$$$\vSomething like this...
\vThis is a pretty tricky question.$$$$\vIt all started from the basement of the house from which your hero began his journey...$$$$$$\vFrom the very beginning there was an illegal laboratory of Zazarchik, where he was engaged in the preparation of all kinds of moonshine...$$$$$$$$\vBut once he was not liked by his neighbors, because of which they called the police, who discovered the basement with \vall the forbidden things...$$$$$$$$\vIn general, they tied the "Moonshiner", and the house was at the disposal of the director of the local institute...$$$$$$$\vWell, then you yourself roughly know...They did a variety of things: legal-illegal, safe-dangerous, and innovatively useless products...$$$$$$$\vBUT! With the expansion of the research institute, other ways out of it appeared.$$$$$$\vThat is all I know now...
